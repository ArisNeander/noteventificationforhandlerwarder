If you are familiar with tools like Naemon, Nagios, Icinga, etc., then you are likely acquainted with the concepts of *Notification* and *Event Handler*. Notification involves sending an alert to various destinations such as email, SMS, or a ticketing system, while Event Handler refers to an automatic attempt to repair a monitored item when the core detects a problem.

In both cases, you often find yourself writing your own scripts, as there are typically few built-in tools available, aside from those for sending emails. Additionally, it's essential to manage proper logging because, sooner or later, someone may miss a notification, and you'll need to demonstrate that it was indeed sent.

So, with every notification script or event handler, you may find yourself reinventing the wheel and creating new scripts by copying and pasting existing ones. This framework aims to streamline this process by handling tasks such as logging, spooling, and resending failed notifications, ultimately reducing the amount of code you need to write.
